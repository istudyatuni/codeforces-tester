## How to install shell completions
All completion files are generated by invoking `cdf completions` command. So run:

### Bash
```sh
cdf completions bash > /etc/bash_completion.d/cdf.bash
```

### Fish
```sh
cdf completions fish > $HOME/.config/fish/completions/cdf.fish
```

### Zsh
ZSH completions are commonly stored in any directory listed in your `$fpath` variable. To use these completions,
write completions script (`_cdf`) to one of those directories, or add your own to this list.

This list includes, for example, these directories:

- `/usr/local/share/zsh/site-functions`
- `/usr/share/zsh/site-functions`

So you can run:
```sh
cdf completions zsh > /usr/local/share/zsh/site-functions/_cdf
```
